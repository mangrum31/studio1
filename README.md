# Game Arcade

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and built-in Firebase Studio. It contains a collection of simple, fun games.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or later) and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Install the project dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application by opening [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.
-   `npm start`: Starts a Next.js production server.

-   `npm run typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.
